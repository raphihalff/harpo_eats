I can’t remember ever having a bad meal. I’ve eaten in {place} at San Simeon, at {place} and {place}, and the finest restaurants in Paris. But the eating place I remember best, out of the days when I was chronically half starved, is a joint that was called {place}. At {place}, a {dish} cost {price} per square foot, and for {price} more you could buy a {dish} smothered with {dish} and a glass of {dish}. But the absolutely most delicious food I ever ate was prepared by the most inspired chef I ever knew—my father. My father had to be inspired, because he had so little to work with.

This task would have been hopeless to anybody else in the world, but Frenchie always managed to put a meal on the table. With food he was a true magician. Given a couple of short ribs, a wilting cabbage, a handful of soup greens, a bag of chestnuts and a pinch of spices, he could conjure up {dish}. God, how fabulous the tenement smelled when Frenchie, chopping and ladling, sniffing and stirring and tasting, and forever smiling and humming to himself, got the kitchen up to full steam!

What took really big money was {place}. Dining at {place} was the supreme luxury of my young life. Not that the food there was any better cooked than the food we had at home—when we had food. No common commercial chef could ever compete with Frenchie. But {place} included things that Frenchie could only dream of putting on our table: Greenpoint {dish} and {dish} on the half shell, deviled {dish}, grilled {dish}, French fried {dish}, a juicy {dish}, hot {dish} soaked with {dish}, {dish} with a slab of {dish}, and {dish} rich with thick, sweet {dish}. As I said, a meal like this took really big money. It cost {price}.

We took the streetcar from 93rd Street to 125th Street, where we were to catch the train. When we got to 125th Street, Mintz said we had time to have a bite before the train left. It was always good to take off with a good meal under your belt, he said. Never knew what kind of food you would find in the sticks. So we went to {place} on Lenox Avenue. “Order everything you want and forget about the price,” my partner said. “Seymour Mintz is no piker.” I ate the best meal I’d had since my last dinner at {place}—the {price} {dish} Five-Course Special. When {dish} came, Mintz leaned back in his chair and waved the proprietor over and demanded to see a selection of cigars. The proprietor brought four or five boxes to our table, but Mintz didn’t like any of them. Too cheap. He waved the proprietor away and said he would go to the cigar store next door and get a decent Havana. Be right back, he said.

I was sorry to leave the garment district. I had just worked out a dodge for getting a full-course meal for {price}. This required that I eat in a long, narrow restaurant at rush hour, when the joint was jammed like a six-o’clock subway car. I would order a full-course meal at a table in the rear, then take the check and fight my way to a table in the front, where I’d order a {dish} and {dish}. The check for this—for {price}—was the one I’d pay, having torn up the check for the de luxe luncheon. I had to watch my pennies that year. I was still paying off the money Minnie had borrowed from Uncle Al, and I kicked in most of the rest of my salary to the family. This left me barely enough for carfare, plus a nickel a day for dinner, plus an occasional two cents to treat myself to a {place}’s ice-cream cone.

At {place}, {dish} sold for {price} per square foot. {dish} to wash it down cost {price} per pint glass. A jumbo {dish}, oozing with {dish} and smothered with {dish}, was {price}. And while you were eating, countermen would yell out the day’s specials, to keep your appetite whetted: “Take a fresh-baked {dish} home to Mother! {price} apiece!” “Give the family a treat tonight! Whaddaya say? Today only—{dish}, double size {price}!” With the boss holed up cozily in his saloon, I could take an hour and a half or two hours for lunch. All I could eat at {place}.

Naturally, nobody had ever tasted food like Frenchie’s in Cedar Rapids, Kalamazoo or Urbana, and that was why he was always being asked to stay in town and open up a restaurant. When Frenchie wasn’t there to do the cooking, we ate leftovers. Boardinghouse leftovers were the same from Seattle to Sandusky: cold {dish} with all the {dish} picked out, stiff, cold dabs of {dish} turning yellow at the edges, a lonely {dish} floating amongst seeds in a bowl of {dish}, moldering masses of stale {dish}, and {dish} three times warmed over with {dish} in it, turned a sickening mauve in color and covered with a pucker of scum. I didn’t complain. I was too hungry.

That winter, the winter of Cocoanuts, we took to bringing in snacks from home and {place} for our poker sessions and ordering less food at the {place}. Apparently, the room-service waiter complained to the management, because one Saturday night there was a large, hand-painted sign tacked to the inside of the door of our suite:
Basket Parties Not Welcome
—Frank Case, Proprietor

Joe Hennessey actually ran the club. Joe, besides being Woollcott’s private secretary, did the ordering, kept the books, kept the handyman busy on the grounds, saw that guests were met on the mainland and were assigned places to sleep, and made sure that Aleck’s {dish} were properly broiled. {dish} was Aleck’s staple food. When he ordered dinner in a restaurant he put on quite a scene. He would keep the waiter bringing out {dish} until he found the exact cut that suited him. Then he would tell him, with elaborate gestures, exactly how the chef should prepare it: “Passed slowly over the flame—so—then turned and passed over the flame once again—so.” God forbid if it should arrive any other way except charred on the outside and cold, bloody raw on the inside.

Some of the writers’ favorite bits didn’t get a snicker. They were cut. On the other hand, stuff that we ad libbed on stage, as in the “stateroom scene,” went into the shooting script. As written—a bunch of guys jamming into a stateroom for no very good reason—this bit failed to get a laugh on stage. The writers got very depressed over it and decided to cut it. We decided, however, to give it one more chance. So this night we did it our way. Groucho, ordering a meal from a steward while being jostled into the corner of the jammed-up stateroom, said, “And a hard-boiled {dish}. . .” I honked my horn. “Make it two hard-boiled {dish},” said Groucho. The audience broke up, and as simply as that, a dud became a classic. The stateroom scene is still the best remembered of any bit the Marx Brothers ever performed.
